# A-Research-Agent-
A Research Agent is an AI tool that automates academic tasks like literature search, summarization, and citation using IBM Cloud Lite and IBM Granite. It saves time, boosts accuracy, and enhances research. Watson Discovery and Granite models enable smart NLP, making research faster, smarter, and more efficient.
📌 Problem Addressed
Research today involves sifting through vast amounts of academic papers, managing citations, and keeping track of constantly updating knowledge—all of which is time-consuming and overwhelming. Manual methods lead to inefficiencies, missed insights, and limited innovation. Researchers, especially students and early-career scientists, lack smart tools to streamline these tasks.

📘 Project Summary
Research Agent is an AI-powered assistant that automates literature search, summarization, citation management, and hypothesis generation. Using IBM Granite and IBM Cloud Lite services, it employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to understand research questions and respond with accurate, relevant insights—improving productivity and research quality.
